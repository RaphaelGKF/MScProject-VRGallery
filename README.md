# Brief
A virtual reality experience takes you into a gallery-like setting; where you are free to interact and submerge yourself in the artworks. This Virtual environment is an innovative approach to digitise and enrich the presence and immersiveness of contemporary art. It serves as a way to deepen the connection between the artist, the significance of their creation, and the viewers interpretation of said creation.

The Artists featured are pseudonyms and a mixture of my own name.

# Build
There are two build versions available to you: PC BUILD (Desktop) and VR BUILD (Oculus Quest 2).

Note: As this project was designed primarily for VR Headsets, the desktop version of this project has restricted functionality and simply allows you to browse the scene rather than interact 

# Controls
- Use your VR Controller to navigate through 
  the scene.
- Interact directly with grabbable objects aided 
  by haptic feedback.
- Use the pointer on the right hand controller 
  to grab an object towards your direction.
- Use the pointer to interact with the UI buttons.
  (Interactable objects turn the pointer white)
- Move around using the left joystick and turn 
  with the right joystick.

# Walkthrough Tutorial 



* This world is best experienced with the use of headphones and a VR Headset *
