# Brief
A virtual reality experience takes you into a gallery-like setting; where you are free to interact and submerge yourself in the artworks. This Virtual environment is an innovative approach to digitise and enrich the presence and immersiveness of contemporary art. It serves as a way to deepen the connection between the artist, the significance of their creation, and the viewers interpretation of said creation.

## Main Gallery
In the main Gallery, You are exposed to three-dimensional paintings, view them from any angle and view it's depth. This is a new way of experiencing art.

At the center of the gallery, you can find the sculpture, Suzanne. This sculpture is always locked onto the sphere below it. Grab the sphere and she wont take her eyes off it. Throw it around and find out.
The works displayed here were created using Gravity Sketch as 3D models.The main concept and source of inspiration was afrocentrism.. This style of art display offers a three-dimensional approach for viewing artworks from a variety of perspectives.

The other section features photographs that have been digitally altered and photomerged in Adobe Photoshop.This provides a window into the author's thoughts; His view that all forms of artistic expression are interconnected.
As well as, three sculptures you can interact with. try picking them up. You are allowed to do this unlike a real museum or art gallery.

## Art Gallery
Art Exhibits are some of the principal ways in which artists communicate their ideas, concepts and messages in their artwork.  

The Art Gallery section has some of the most impactful creations in this project. You are able to view these images----
These artworks were created by myself, assisted by AI Generative algorithym, and Adobe Photoshop. influenced by vintage African art. Each of the paintings are accompanied by moving songs which can be heard when you approach the works. This will deepen the viewing experience and help the spectator understand the significance of the artwork.The theme of this section largely relies on the topic of freedom,
justice and pride. The highlighted works are motivated by the impact of Black Culture in the music industry, Civil Rights, Pride and the BLM movement.
Discover artists like Kanye West, Jacob Banks, and Michael Kiwanuka, whose ground-breaking music is paired with the artworks.

## 3D Music Visualizer Experience
Equipped with a radio and 13 musically responsive spheres. You have a choice of four tracks to play. The UI visible just below the radio allows you to control the song. Each sphere responds to the track's beat to a varied degree of intensity. 
When the spheres touch another object, their colours change. You can shoot the spheres with an (anti-gravity) gun and play around in the environment,which you can use to shoot the spheres to change the colors. This enables you to experiment while fully engaging to the experience.
